# Executive Summary

This research report delves into the real-world risks and benefits of using synthetic data to train or fine-tune large language models. The analysis focuses on data quality, bias, and evaluation methods to provide a comprehensive understanding of the implications of synthetic data usage in language models.

## Research Angles

- **Data quality perspective**
- **Bias analysis perspective**
- **Evaluation methods perspective**

## Claims and Supporting Evidence

### Data Quality Perspective

- **Claim**: Inconsistent tokenization and vocabulary size during training can impact data quality and model performance.
  - **Evidence**: Investigating Data Quality of Large Language Models
    - Relevant quote: "When large language models are trained on inconsistent tokenization, vocabulary size, it impacts quality of data and performance of language models."

### Bias Analysis Perspective

- **Claim**: Overuse of synthetic data can lead to biases, model degradation, and reduced generalizability in language models.
  - **Evidence**: Navigating Data Challenges in the Digital Revolution
    - Relevant quote: "Although synthetic data address crucial shortages of real-world training data, their overuse might propagate biases, accelerate model degradation, and compromise generalisability across populations."

### Evaluation Methods Perspective

- **Claim**: Synthetic data can be evaluated using standardized settings and metrics to assess data generation capabilities.
  - **Evidence**: Evaluating Language Models as Synthetic Data Generators
    - Key finding: The study proposes AGORABENCH, a benchmark for evaluating language models' data generation capabilities.

## Focus Areas

### Understanding the Implications of Using Synthetic Data in Language Models

- **Risks**: Fidelity gaps, model collapse, bias amplification, computational costs, and evaluation difficulties.
