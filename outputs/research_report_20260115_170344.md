# Executive Summary

This research report delves into the real-world risks and benefits of using synthetic data to train or fine-tune large language models. The analysis focuses on data quality, bias, and evaluation methods to provide a comprehensive understanding of the implications of incorporating synthetic data in model training. Through a review of various sources, this report aims to shed light on the complexities and considerations associated with the use of synthetic data in the development of language models.

## Research Angles

1. **Data Quality Perspective**
2. **Bias Analysis Perspective**
3. **Evaluation Methods Perspective**

## Claims and Supporting Evidence

### Data Quality Perspective

- **Claim:** The impact of data quality and training strategies on model performance for language models needs to be revisited.
  - **Evidence:** Extensive empirical evidence is used to examine the scaling laws and the effects of data quality and training strategies on model performance.

- **Claim:** Synthetic data can be used to train or fine-tune large language models, but its quality and biases must be carefully considered.
  - **Evidence:** De Padua warns of the risk of synthetic data not accurately representing the diversity of the real-world population, leading to potential bias in models.

### Bias Analysis Perspective

- **Claim:** De Padua highlights the importance of ensuring that synthetic data accurately reflects the diversity of the real-world population to avoid bias in models.
  - **Evidence:** Challenges in using synthetic data for LLMs include fidelity gaps, model collapse, bias amplification, computational costs, and evaluation difficulties.

### Evaluation Methods Perspective

- **Claim:** AI models trained primarily on synthetic data without real data may lead to a decrease in model quality over time.
  - **Evidence:** The dangers and risks of depending on synthetic data include bias amplification, lack of real-world representativeness, data drift and model decay, compounding errors, and intellectual property concerns.

## Focus Areas

### Data Quality Considerations in Synthetic Data Usage

- **Risk:** Potential bias amplification and lack of real-world representativeness in synthetic data.
- **Benefit:** Augmenting training datasets with synthetic data to improve model performance.

### Identification and Mitigation of Bias in Synthetic Data

- **Risk:** Challenges in ensuring that synthetic data accurately reflects the diversity of the real-world population.
- **Benefit:** Using synthetic data to fill gaps in traditional datasets and reduce biases in model performance.

### Comparison of Performance Metrics Between Models Trained on Synthetic and Real Data

- **Risk:** Model degradation over time when trained primarily on synthetic data.
- **Benefit:** Enhancing model performance and robustness through the use of diverse and high-quality synthetic data.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, the use of synthetic data in training or fine-tuning large language models presents both risks and benefits. While synthetic data can help overcome data scarcity, improve model performance, and reduce costs, it also poses challenges related to bias amplification, lack of representativeness, and model degradation over time. To mitigate these risks, careful consideration of data quality, bias identification, and evaluation methods is essential in the integration of synthetic data into language model development. Further research and advancements in synthetic data generation techniques are crucial to harnessing the full potential of synthetic data in AI development.
