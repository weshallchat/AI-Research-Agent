# Executive Summary

This research report delves into the real-world risks and benefits of using synthetic data to train or fine-tune large language models. The analysis focuses on data quality, bias, and evaluation methods in the context of synthetic data generation. Through a comprehensive review of various sources, this report aims to provide insights into the challenges and advantages associated with the use of synthetic data in language model training.

## Research Angles

- **Data quality perspective**
- **Bias analysis perspective**
- **Evaluation methods perspective**

## Data Quality Considerations in Synthetic Data

- **Claims:**
  - Synthetic data generation using large language models offers benefits such as cost-effectiveness, broad coverage, and controllable diversity.
  - Challenges include factual inaccuracies in generated text, insufficient stylistic or distributional realism, and risks of bias amplification.

- **Supporting Evidence:**
  - The study by Evaluating Synthetic Data for Tool-Using LLMs suggests that models trained on high-quality synthetic data outperform those trained on unvalidated data, emphasizing the importance of data quality in large language models.

## Identification and Mitigation of Bias in Synthetic Data

- **Claims:**
  - Synthetic data may propagate biases and accelerate model development, posing risks of bias amplification and lack of real-world representativeness.
  
- **Supporting Evidence:**
  - The Dangers and Risks of Depending on Synthetic Data from Large Language Models highlights the dangers associated with bias amplification, lack of representativeness, and data drift when using synthetic data.

## Comparison of Evaluation Methods for Synthetic Data in Language Models

- **Claims:**
  - Intrinsic features of data quality such as response quality, perplexity, and instruction difficulty are better indicators than traditional metrics for evaluating synthetic data generated by language models.
  
- **Supporting Evidence:**
  - Evaluating Language Models as Synthetic Data Generators suggests that multiple intrinsic features of data quality are crucial for assessing the performance of synthetic data in language models.

## Case Studies of Using Synthetic Data in Training Large Language Models

- **Claims:**
  - Challenges of using synthetic data for large language models include fidelity gaps, model collapse, bias amplification, computational costs, and evaluation difficulties.
  
- **Supporting Evidence:**
  - Challenges and Pitfalls of Using Synthetic Data for LLMs highlights the various challenges associated with synthetic data usage, including fidelity gaps, bias amplification, and evaluation difficulties.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, the use of synthetic data in training large language models presents both risks and benefits. While synthetic data offer advantages such as cost-effectiveness and privacy preservation, challenges related to data quality, bias amplification, and evaluation methods must be carefully considered. Future research should focus on developing strategies to mitigate bias, improve data quality, and enhance evaluation methods to maximize the benefits of synthetic data in language model training.
