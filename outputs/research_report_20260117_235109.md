# Research Report: Real-World Risks and Benefits of Using Synthetic Data to Train or Fine-Tune Large Language Models

## Executive Summary

This report explores the real-world risks and benefits of using synthetic data for training or fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). The focus is on data quality, bias, and evaluation methodologies. The research angles include a comparison of synthetic versus real-world data, the impact of synthetic data on bias, evaluation frameworks, ethical considerations, and industry applications. The findings reveal that while synthetic data offers significant advantages in terms of cost, privacy, and data availability, it also poses challenges related to data quality and bias. The report concludes with recommendations for leveraging synthetic data effectively while mitigating associated risks.

### Comparative Analysis of Performance Metrics

- **Discussion:** Comparing the performance of LLMs trained on synthetic versus real-world data is crucial for understanding the trade-offs involved. Evidence 5 and 6 suggest that synthetic data can enhance performance while addressing data availability issues.

## Conclusions

Synthetic data offers significant benefits for training and fine-tuning large language models, particularly in terms of cost reduction, privacy preservation, and addressing data availability challenges. However, it also presents risks related to data quality and bias. To leverage synthetic data effectively, it is essential to develop robust evaluation frameworks, address ethical concerns, and implement strategies to mitigate bias. By doing so, synthetic data can be a powerful tool in the advancement of language models across various industries.
